    I used to lie on the floor for hours after
    <br>
school with the phone cradled between
<br>
my shoulder and my ear, a plate of cold
<br>
rice to my left, my school books to my right.
<br>
Twirling the cord between my fingers
<br>
I spoke to friends who recognized the
<br>
language of our realm. Throats and lungs
<br>
swollen, we talked into the heart of the night,
<br>
toying with the idea of hair dye and suicide,
<br>
<pre>about the boys who did not love us, 
    who we loved too much, the pang
    of the nights. Each sentence was
    new territory, like a door someone was
    rushing into, the glass shattering
    with delirium, with knowledge and fear.
                  My Mother never complained about the phone bill,
        what it cost for her daughter to disappear
            behind a door, watching the cord
       stretching its muscle away from her.
    Perhaps she thought it was the only way
    she could reach me, sending me away
    to speak in the underworld.
    As long as I was speaking
        she could put my ear to the tenuous earth
    and allow me to listen, to decipher.
        And these were the elements of my Mother,
             the earthed wire, the burning cable,
       as if she flowed into the room with
     me to somehow say, Stay where I can reach you,
    the dim room, the dark earth. Speak of this
    and when you feel removed from it
    I will pull the cord and take you
    back towards me.
